# Yii Sentry Log

Yii sentry log is a component for Yii to send all logging and exception to sentry server instead of showing it on screen or save it on files, especially when you set ```YII_DEBUG``` to ```false```, this module based on [raven-php](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-php) by [getsentry](https://github.com/getsentry)

RSentryComponent can be used to have proper trace back messages to use with the yii log

## Requirement

- Yii Framework >1.1.x
- [Sentry](https://www.getsentry.com/)

## Configuring

- Put your clone or copy all files to ```/protected/components/yii-sentry-log```
- Edit your ```config.php```

```php
    ...
    'components'=>array(
    	...
        'log'=>array(
            'class'=>'CLogRouter',
            'routes'=>array(
                array(
                    'class'=>'application.components.yii-sentry-log.RSentryLog',
                    'dsn'=> '[YOUR_DSN_FROM_SENTRY_SERVER]',
                    'levels'=>'error, warning',
                ),                
            ),
        ),
        ...
    )
    ...
```

- With RSentryComponent thanks to @BoontjieSA, just worked for ```warning``` level and unfortunately its not running on a public server at the moment.

```php
    'preload'=> array('log', 'RSentryException'),
    'components'=>array(
    	...
    	'RSentryException'=> array(
    	    'dsn'=> '[YOUR_DSN_FROM_SENTRY_SERVER]',
            'class' => 'application.components.yii-sentry-log.RSentryComponent',
    	),
        'log'=>array(
            'class'=>'CLogRouter',
            'routes'=>array(
                array(
                    'class'=>'application.components.yii-sentry-log.RSentryLog',
                    'dsn'=> '[YOUR_DSN_FROM_SENTRY_SERVER]',
                    'levels'=>'warning',
                ),                
            ),
        ),
        ...
    )
    ...
```
